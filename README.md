# IST 659 Database Management

<!-- Class and Project Description
  The Database Management class taught by Chad Harper, covered the fundamentals
of database design and implementation. It focused on designing entity relationships, normalization, and building these structures using SQL Server. The lab assignments for this class aimed to reinforce each step required for building a database from scratch using Video Casting as an example. The early lab assignments focused on building entity relationships and designing data tables. Understanding the types of connections was crucial to the overall database design. This included creating primary and foreign keys with varying types of connections (one to many, one to one, many to many). The lab assignments that followed focused on teaching the SQL skills required for creating a database. This included querying data, creating tables, updating and inserting into these tables, altering tables, and concepts such as views, indexes, stored procedures, functions, and transactions. Later on, these labs introduced the important concept of database security by defining roles and permissions. Ultimately the SQL database was connected through SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) in order to implement descriptive statistics.
	The project for this class involved building a database of house plant in
order to distinguish the different types of care and propagation. The first part of this project was determining what characteristics were essential to the care of a plant. A data dictionary was created in order to provide an outline to the database. This dictionary consisted of five tables: plant, propagation, origin, leaf, and care instructions. Within each of these tables, various columns were identified, for example, the leaf table contained shape, color, and physical attributes. This data dictionary was then used to create an entity relationship diagram or logical model using draw.io to visualize the database relationships. Using raw SQL scripts, the database was constructed with the tables and columns listed in the ER diagram. Ultimately, the database contained seven tables: plant detail, leaf detail, leaf shape, plant name, plant detail propagation, propagation, and care instructions. Two of the tables, leaf detail and plant detail propagation acted as junction tables to accommodate many to many relationships. Once constructed, the tables were populated using the plant information saved in Microsoft Excel. This Excel file contained all the recorded details of the house plants. The SQL Server database was linked to Microsoft Access where various forms could be created. These forms would allow users to save additional plant information to the SQL database. This Access file would act as rudimentary software to provide the care and propagation instructions for each of the plants.

Learning Objectives
  The goal for this class involved understanding the lift-cycle of database
development. This would include the understanding of data and database concepts. This course also intended to teach the fundamentals of SQL, the scripting language of databases. The project emphasized all the steps required for constructing a database from early design to implementation. Data management teachings included data security, privacy, and backup/recovery while database design teaching included modeling and data normalization. The project reinforced the step-by-step methods of database development. By starting with a business problem (How to properly care for and propagate house plants), the practicality and implementation of a database can be more easily understood. The forms and reports that connected to the SQL Server database are examples of how software and analysis rely on good database design. Analytical insights and software functionality are dependent on the database in which they connect. When a business question is proposed, the database must be constructed according to business use cases. Databases are an essential part of data science as a whole. The class and project bring these two parts of data science together through the connection of the database to analytical and visualization software using SSMS. -->
